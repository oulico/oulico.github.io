## Welcome to my new blog!

This is my very first post. I'm excited to start writing.

Here is a code block:
```javascript
console.log("Hello, from the new blog!");
```



## Mermaid Diagram Example

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Is it hot?};
    B -- Yes --> C{Drink Water};
    B -- No --> D{Eat Ice Cream};
    C --> E[End];
    D --> E;
```
